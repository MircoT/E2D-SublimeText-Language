E2D-SublimeText-Language
========================

Resources for E2D Script in Sublime Text. E2D Script is a *markup language* for E2D Engine.

# Installation

In the future can be added via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) manager.  


At the moment you must clone the git repository directly inside your Sublime "Packages" directory.

```git clone https://github.com/MircoT/E2D-SublimeText-Language.git "E2D-Script```

This way, you'll be able to "git pull" to update the package, and Sublime will see the changes immediately. You can use the Preferences>Browse Packages menu within Sublime to get to the Packages directory.

Otherwise, clone elsewhere and copy the files into a folder called "E2D-Script" in the Packages directory.
